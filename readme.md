<h1>MOST Planetary Extruder Drive</h1>
<p>This is derived from Airtripper's Bowden extruder drive (http://airtripper.com/1071/airtrippers-bowden-extruder-v3-updated-design/).
</p>
<p>
It resolves:
* Torque issues - print speed can limited by torque of the drive motor. The 4.62:1 planetary gearbox overcomes this.
* Inability to live-feed new filament - the original design had the filament path too far into the drive gear pretty much eliminating the possibility of live-feeding filament through the drive. The filament path has been moved and an infeed sheath was added to facilitate live feeding.

<h2>Printing</h2>
Print gears singly with the planet gears printed on a raft to maintain shape of teeth on first layer. Print slowly with lots of cooling.

<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p>All of the case parts are printed with an arrow-shaped screw boss to indicate how the pieces are aligned when assembled.</p>
<p>Assemble planetary carrier first. Press 624z bearings into planetary gears. Put M4 screws through the bearing and then place three washers on each screw. Push the M5 screw into the planetary carrier fully seating the head of the screw in the recess provided. Press M4 nylock nuts into the planetary carrier and thread the screws into the nuts. Leave the screws very loose so that the planet gears can be moved out of the way to facilitate insertion of sun gear</p>
<p>Press an M3 nut into the nut trap on the sun gear and thread the set screw into the nut. Work the sun gear into the planet gears and then tighten the M4 screws.</p>
<p>Attach the motor end to the NEMA17 motor with the M3 x 12mm screws, each with a washer.</p>
<p>Press the sun gear side of the planetary carrier assembly into the input half. Press the output half onto the opposite side of the planetary carrier assembly. Place the 625 bearing in the pocket on the extruder end. Press a pair of M3 nuts into the recesses on the inlet side of the extruder end where the linking bar will go. Attach the linking bar with the M3 x 30mm screws. Pass the M5 screw extending from the plantary carrier through the 625 bearing. Rotate the gear box several times to clean the teeth and ensure that everything moves properly.</p>
<p>Align the flat side of the shaft relief in the sun gear (where the set screw is) with the side of the motor end having the set screw access hole in it (opposite the arrow-shaped screw boss). Align the motor shaft and press the sun gear onto it compressing the entire case assembly until there is little gap between them. Pass the M3 x 40mm screws with washers on them through the holes in the cases and affix M3 nuts to them. Do not tighten the nuts too much. Tighten the set screw in the sun gear against the motor shaft. Spray white lithium grease into the case and rotate the gearbox such that all of the gears are coated with lubricant.</p>
<p>Put the Mk7 drive gear on the M5 screw. Pass filament through the path and ensure that the gear is properly aligned. Tighten the set screw in the drive gear. Drill a pair of 3mm holes in the fuel line aligning them with the slots in the idler housing. Attach the fuel hose to the extruder end with a pair of M3 x 45mm screws with washers in the hose side. Attach the idler to the extruder end, tucking the M3 x 45mm screws into the slots on the idler housing.</p>
<p>Exercise the drive with no filament in it or several minutes to ensure that motion is smooth and no binding occurs. Tighten the case screws and check again for binding. If the gear box binds, loosen the case screws.</p>
